/**
 * Escape characters with special meaning either inside or outside character sets.
 * Use a simple backslash escape when it’s always valid, and a `\xnn` escape when the simpler form would be disallowed by Unicode patterns’ stricter grammar.
 *
 * When the `unicodeMode` is `true` (default), the `-` character is escaped as `\x2d` to ensure compatibility with Unicode patterns, PCRE, and MongoDB.
 *
 * You should only disable this option if you are escaping regular expressions that will later be consumed by runtimes w/o unicode flag support.
